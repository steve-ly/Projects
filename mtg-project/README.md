# MTG Project (Currently In Progress)
I have acquired a crippling addiction to collecting Magic the gathering cards, particulary precons for the format Commander(EDH). 
I want to get my friends into it and as a way to make it competitive, I wanted to make a tournament that relies on only using the preconstructed decks
I have inorder to battle it out in a sort of weekly clash where placements determine your results. After a set amount of weeks, The final top 4 will play it a
final game to determine who gets the prize, which at this point is still up in the air. This project is essentially a way for me to further my addicition in combination with working on my 
frontend development skills so that I can convince my friends to play :ROFL:
